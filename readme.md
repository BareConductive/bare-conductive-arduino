# Bare Conductive Arduino Hardware Plugins

Board definitions for Bare Conductive Arduino-compatible boards, needed to use the [Bare Conductive Touch Board](http://www.bareconductive.com/touch-board) with full functionality in the [Arduino IDE](http://arduino.cc/en/main/software). 

## Requirements

* Arduino 1.6.6 or later


## Install

1. Close the Arduino IDE if you have it open.
1. Download the [.zip](https://github.com/bareconductive/bare-conductive-arduino/archive/public.zip) or clone the repository to your local machine - if downloading the .zip, extract the contents somewhere that suits you.
1. Take the **bare-conductive-arduino-public** folder and move it to **Arduino Hardware Folder**. This will be different for each operating system: 

	**Windows**
	
	Libraries\\Documents\\Arduino\\hardware
	
	or
	
	My Documents\\Arduino\\hardware
	
	**Mac**
	
	Documents/Arduino/hardware
	
	**Linux (Ubuntu)**
	
	Home/Arduino/hardware


	If this folder does not exist, create it first.
1. Reopen the Arduino IDE - you should now be able to select Bare Conductive Touch Board in the **Tools -> Board** menu.
